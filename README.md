</p>

**Student in IT Engineering**. Specialized in Object Oriented Programmations, particularly in **Java and C#**, i'm also interested by system infrastructure throught **Active Directory Environnement** and **Virtualization** (ESXI, GCP, AWS, VEEAM).
I'm making some tools in Python and Java for **CTF**, otherwise I'm a video game developer trought **Unity3D and Godot Engine**.

I am questioning between a career in **cybersecurity or video games**.
**Sensitive to philosophy**, I am very interested about questions around **artificial intelligence** and more precisely on the definition of **artificial consciousness** (~~which is the same to artificial intelligence~~ **which is very different**).
